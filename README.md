# MILESTONE PROJECT 2 - Language Acquisition Memory Game - Interactive Front End

## Project Summary:
### The goal of this project will be to design and create a simple pattern matching memory game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The main goal for both the user and the site owner will be to have a game that is enjoyable to play. I will also include a 'language acquisition' component to this memory game which will highlight the versatility of this type of project and how it can be utilised for educational purposes while still being enjoyable which should expand the appeal of this website to a wider audience.

### <u>**STRATEGY -**</ul>

#### SITE OWNER GOALS:
The main goal of this project is to create an interactive website which hosts a single player, pattern matching game with a language acquisition component. This game should be fun for any user and should make the user want to return to the website to play again. This will hopefully be achieved by using fun and unique images and music throughout this project. The language acquisition component will hopefully broaden the appeal of this game to users, educators and parents which should will mean a higher base of users and more people who could potential enjoy playing the game and have fun!  

Target audience 
- People who like games 
- Early language learners
- Parents of young game users
- Educators

### **SCOPE -**

This project will be a minimal viable product containing the aspects that are vital to functionality and an acceptable standard of aesthetic value, but with lots of opportunity to develop further in the future.

Functional specifications: 
-Navigation
-Card Flip mechanism
-Card Match mechanism
-Email contact form

Content specifications:
- Tutorial overlay
- Custom artwork
- Custom music
- Win/Lose overlays

### **STRUCTURE -**

The website is laid out over three pages. 
These pages are 
1.Landing Game Page (Game in English/Irish) 
2.Secondary Game Page (Game in English/French)
3.Contact Page 

The two game pages (1 + 2)contain three overlays, these will instruct the player: 
-how to play
-tell users if they have won the game
-tell users if they have lost the game
When a player clicks on this first overlay (after being prompted on screen to click) the game will begin. When this happens the background music will start and a timer, which will start at 100 seconds, will begin to countdown to zero. When the timer reaches zero the game will end. 

Pages 1 & 2 will contain 12 cards which will resemble playing cards. These cards will each contain a different image of an animal (repeating twice) to create six pairs of cards. Each pair will have the name of the animal that it contains written on it, one will have the English and the other will have the Irish (or French on Page 2) on it. On the reverse side all cards will be identical, containing a farmyard fence and a question mark. When a player clicks on a card it will flip over and they must select a second card to find it's match. If the player finds all 6 matches before the 100 seconds is over then they will win the game and the 'Victory' overlay will appear on screen. If they cannot find both matches before the 100 seconds elapses then they will lose and the 'Lose' overlay will appear on screen. A 'click to restart' prompt will appear on both of these screens. 

The contact page (pg3) will contain a very simple feedback form that will send an email to the author of the website. When all fields are correctly filled out and the feedback has been successfully sent, a thank you message will appear in the feedback box. 


### **SKELETON -** 

Differences between final design and wireframes:

There were no major differences between the final design or the website and the original wireframes. One slight adjustment was made to the wireframes for the first two pages of the site (Landing Game Page and Secondary Game Page) and mobile display adjustments needed to be made to the number of columns that were displayed and this changed from an original plan of 3 columns to the final layout of 2 columns at that media size. The contact page was kept in a very simple style which was scalable across all media sizes. As can be seen from the wireframe model at the beginning of this document, the layout remained consistent.
