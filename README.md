Business Goals:
The main goal of this project is to create a static website for a business which has operated in traditional trading methods (high street) and has been forced to migrate its business to the online sphere to remain economically viable during the current COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to maintain the services which it has previously provided in a way which is informative and accessible to its target audience/customer base. Furthermore, it will attempt to create a space which is conducive to communication and engagement, where those in the art community can still feel a sense of inclusivity and interconnection.
