MILESTONE PROJECT 2 - Language Acquisition Memory Game - Interactive Front End

Project Summary:
The goal of this project will be to design and create a simple pattern matching memory game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I will also include a 'language acquisition' component to this memory game which will highlight the versatility of this type of project and how it can be utilised for educational purposes while still being enjoyable which should expand the appeal of this website to a wider audience.

Business Goals:
The main goal of this project is to create a static website for a business which has operated in traditional trading methods (high street) and has been forced to migrate its business to the online sphere to remain economically viable during the current COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to maintain the services which it has previously provided in a way which is informative and accessible to its target audience/customer base. Furthermore, it will attempt to create a space which is conducive to communication and engagement, where those in the art community can still feel a sense of inclusivity and interconnection.
